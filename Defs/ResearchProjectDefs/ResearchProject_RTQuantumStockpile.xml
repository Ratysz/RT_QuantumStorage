		<description>Allows construction of quantum stockpiles: devices that are placed underneath stockpile zones in order to store more than one item or stack of items in a given space.
	
When powered, these stockpiles scan zone spaces adjacent to them and, if the zone's filter allows it, pull any items onto themselves, up to 4 items per space.

Items are steadily superposed, so each one remains fully accessible, and nothing catastrophic will happen even if the power supply fails.</description>
